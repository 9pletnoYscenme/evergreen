The fingerprint kit will scan an item for fingerprints, which can be matched to the suspects.
- Don't be afraid to use hints. You can earn hints by finding question marks in the scenes. Each hint will show you the location of one item on your list. You can use as many hints as you want, but remember that they are limited and you won't get any more until you find another question mark.
- Try different modes. The game has two modes: Detective Mode and Relaxed Mode. Detective Mode is the default mode, where you have to solve each case within a time limit. Relaxed Mode is a more casual mode, where you have no time limit and can play at your own pace.
- Have fun and explore. The game has over 20 unique locations to visit, each with its own theme and atmosphere. You can find all kinds of interesting items and details in each scene, some of which are related to the case and some of which are just for fun. Try to find them all and enjoy the game.
